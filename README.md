# Historical-Document-Text-Restoration
The Historical Document Text Restoration project aims to restore and enhance the text extracted from scanned images of historical documents. Using Tesseract OCR, it extracts text from the image, and then applies an AI-powered model (Gemini 1.5) to enhance the extracted text.
